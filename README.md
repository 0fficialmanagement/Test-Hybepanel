# hybe-panel I want you to integrate this onboarding UI with the following flow :

/**
 * 1. User enters a Subscription ID into an input field.
 *    - While the backend is being pinged to validate the ID, show a small spinner at the end of the input box.
 *    - If the ID is valid:
 *       - Smoothly reveal a dropdown-style password field for the user to choose a HYBE password.
 *       - Once password is entered, update the main button text free to: "Create Account".
 * 
 * 2. When the user clicks "Create Account":
 *    - Show a modal (popup) that includes:
 *        - A message informing the user they are creating an official HYBE CORP profile to gain premium access, privileges, and be added to the verified fan database.
 *        - Legal disclaimer:
 *           - Inform them this is an official digital registration process in compliance with South Korean law and K-pop fan community standards.
 *           - State they agree not to misuse, sell, or exploit the services, privileges, or internal communications provided to verified HYBE supporters.
 *           - Add that impersonation or abuse may result in permanent suspension and legal action if necessary.
 *           - Encourage respectful participation within the fandom ecosystem.
 *    - Include a "Continue" button inside the modal to proceed with account creation.
 * 
 * 3. On "Continue":
 *    - Then continue with final validation and submission steps as normal.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * - Use smooth animations/transitions (e.g., dropdown, button state change, modal).
 * - Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
 * - Tailwind CSS + React preferred (optional but recommended).
